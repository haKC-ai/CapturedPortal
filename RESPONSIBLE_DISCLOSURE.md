This project supports and encourages responsible security research. If you discover vulnerabilities using this tool, we ask that you follow these guidelines.

## Disclosure Guidelines

### Before Testing

1. **Obtain explicit written authorization** from the system owner
2. **Define scope clearly** - which systems, networks, and methods are permitted
3. **Establish communication channels** with the asset owner
4. **Document everything** - timestamps, methods, findings

### When You Find a Vulnerability

1. **Do not exploit beyond proof of concept** - demonstrate existence, do not cause damage
2. **Do not access, modify, or exfiltrate data** beyond what is necessary to prove the vulnerability
3. **Do not disrupt services** or degrade system performance
4. **Keep findings confidential** until the vendor has remediated

### Reporting to Vendors

1. **Contact the vendor directly** using their security contact (security@, responsible-disclosure@, or bug bounty program)
2. **Provide clear, reproducible steps** including environment details
3. **Suggest remediation** if possible
4. **Agree on a disclosure timeline** - industry standard is 90 days

### Public Disclosure

- Allow reasonable time for remediation (typically 90 days)
- Coordinate disclosure timing with the vendor
- Redact sensitive details that could enable exploitation
- Credit the vendor for responsive handling when appropriate

## What We Consider Ethical Use

| Acceptable | Unacceptable |
|------------|--------------|
| Testing your own networks | Accessing networks without authorization |
| Authorized penetration tests | Intercepting others' communications |
| Security research with permission | Credential theft or session hijacking |
| CTF competitions | Disrupting services (DoS) |
| Educational lab environments | Selling access or data |

## Legal Considerations

Security research exists in a complex legal landscape. Before conducting any testing:

- Review the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (US)
- Review the Computer Misuse Act (UK)
- Check local laws in your jurisdiction
- Understand that "good intentions" are not a legal defense
- Consider consulting legal counsel for commercial engagements
