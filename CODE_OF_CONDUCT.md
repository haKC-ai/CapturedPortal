We are committed to fostering a community that advances security knowledge while maintaining the highest ethical standards.

## Principles

### 1. Authorization First

Never access systems without explicit permission. When in doubt, do not proceed.

Use the least invasive methods necessary. Do not disrupt services or access data beyond what is required to demonstrate a finding.

### 3. Protect Privacy

Respect the privacy of individuals. Do not collect, store, or disclose personal information encountered during testing.

Report vulnerabilities to affected parties before public disclosure. Give vendors reasonable time to remediate.

### 5. Knowledge Sharing

Share defensive knowledge freely. Help others understand how to protect themselves.

### 6. Legal Compliance

Understand and comply with all applicable laws. Ignorance is not a defense.

### 7. Professional Integrity

Be honest about your findings. Do not exaggerate vulnerabilities or fabricate evidence.
